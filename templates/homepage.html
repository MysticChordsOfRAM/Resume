    <p>
        Operating at the intersection of economics and data engineering, my approach to analysis is defined by total ownership of 
        the data lifecycle. Rather than viewing forecasting as a purely statistical exercise, I treat it as a systems engineering 
        challenge: building the infrastructure to ingest raw data, architecting the SQL pipelines that control it, and developing the 
        reproducible models that drive decision-making. Whether projecting complex state revenue streams or simulating labor market 
        dynamics, I prioritize transparency and scalability, constantly expanding my technical toolkit to modernize how economic 
        insights are generated and delivered.

        <p>
            I first picked up a project with REC in 2024, when they wanted to use data from IPEDS to model the labor capacity of university 
            students. I have been on at least one project with them continuously since then.

            I was hired by the Department in 2021, and have been happily employed there since. Currently, I hold the title <b>Senior Research 
            Economist</b>, having quickly worked my way from the entry level position I started in. My duties at the department include:
            <ul>
                <li>Forecasting Tax Revenue</li>
                <li>Scoring Pending Legislation</li>

                <li>Producing Webforms and Public Data</li>
            </ul>

            As part of my duties, I have successfully automated every web form we produce, as well as investigated and validated the data down to 
            source.

        <h3>Peace Corps Ghana</h3>
        <p>From June 2018 to March of 2020, I was an Education Volunteer in Peace Corps Ghana. I taught Math and Computers at
        Adina AME Zion Junior High School to approximately 300 students. In my time there, I started an extracurricular club
        for students that wanted more class time, funded and painted a world map mural, and worked with the community to 
        start a poultry farm that would provide the school with additional funding. Unfortunately, my time in the country
        was cut short by the Pandemic, but I was there long enough to gain a lasting respect for other cultures, and an
        understanding of all the challenges in developing sustainable change.
